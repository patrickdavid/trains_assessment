What It Does

This program is for both commuter and conductor by train. It tracks all of the stops, lines, and stations in a given metro system. A conductor can add lines, stops, and stations. Each station contains many stops for one or more trains. Each commuter can see when a train is scheduled to stop in a particular station.
